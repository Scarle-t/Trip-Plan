This Final Year Project is called Trip Plan, a social networking app for travel lovers.

Associate of Science in Information Systems Development, Community College of City University

# Description
This project is completed with a team of 4, while I was in charge of the iOS app, website and back-end setup.
Original idea is to create a platform for people to share interesting places with each other, just like Facebook but for travellers.

This is the first time I use Swift for a project, learning it from scratch. Follow some tutorials on YouTube, searching for solutions for stupid questions on StackOverflow and read code on GitHub.
Being new to the language means I need to adopt new syntax style, luckily Swift is kind enough that we can omit semicolon (;). With basic programming skill from C++ and Java, it is quite easy to start with this new language.

About the project itself, we planned to develop 3 platforms, iOS, Android and web. As this is my first time to be a full-stack developer handling front-end (both iOS and web), APIs, back-end (MySQL, Windows Server with IIS), this is quite a challenging project to work on, and I have learnt a lot from it.
